# Marathi News Topic Modeling

This repository contains experiments for topic modeling on Marathi news articles using the L3Cube Marathi LDC dataset. The project explores both Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (via Gensim) to uncover latent topics in the dataset. Additionally, a custom Marathi stopwords list has been created and utilized during text preprocessing.

## Overview

- **Dataset:**  
  The analysis is performed on the [L3Cube Marathi LDC dataset](https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP/tree/main/L3Cube-MahaNews/LDC). This dataset consists of Marathi news articles collected from various sources.


- **Methods Explored:**  
  - **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA):**  
    An exploratory approach to extract topics from the news articles.
  - **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):**  
    Implemented using the Gensim library, this method is used for robust topic extraction.

- **Custom Stopwords:**  
  A curated stopwords list tailored to Marathi news text is used to filter out non-informative words during preprocessing.
